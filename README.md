## Deriving Mendelian Randomization-based Causal Networks of Brain Imaging Phenotypes and Bipolar Disorder

The following scripts can be used to run the analysis in the manuscript titled **Deriving Mendelian Randomization-based Causal Networks of Brain Imaging Phenotypes and Bipolar Disorder** ([preprint link here])(https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2024.12.12.24318953v1). The looping scripts written to run parallel operations have been excluded as they are specific to LSF scheduling systems. 

All of the main analyses can be recreated using the notebook in the notebooks directory of this repo. All of the result matrices are available as downloads in the all_data.zip file in the data directory.
